### Hi there, I'm Chiara 👋

28-year-old from Italy, with a Master Degree in Analytical Chemistry 🧪 and a passion for **Data** 👩‍🏫    

I started my professional course in the analytical chemistry R&D for pharma and oil&gas companies, working both in Italy and in the UK. During this time, I had the chance to work with big amount of data, performing analysis to find meaningful insights for my research projects. This brought me to collaborate with Senior Data Analysts and Scientists, who inspired me with their work and passed me their passon for Data 📊  

Life (and covid) took me on a different path for the past few years, which I spent working as a pharma consultant for validation of computerized systems. Nevertheless, I have never lost my dream of making of Data Analysis my job and that's why between 2023 and beginning of 2024, I have completed a professional certified training in Data Analytics with Boolean, which equipped me with some of those amazing data tools I have always wanted to master: SQL, Python, statistics, Tableu, machine learning and web scraping! Now lookinf forward for the next data challenge 💪
