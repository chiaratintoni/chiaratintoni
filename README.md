### Hi there, I'm Chiara 👋

28-year-old from Italy, with a Master Degree in Analytical Chemistry 🧪 and a passion for **Data** 👩‍🏫    

I started my professional course in the analytical chemistry R&D field for pharma and oil&gas companies, working both in Italy and in the UK. During this time, I had the chance to work with big amount of data, performing analysis to find meaningful insights for my research projects. This brought me to collaborate with Senior Data Analysts and Scientists, who inspired me with their work and passed me their passion for Data 📊  

Life took me on a different path for the past few years, which I spent working as a pharma consultant for validation of computerized systems. Nevertheless, I have never lost my dream of making of Data Analysis my job and that's why between 2023 and beginning of 2024, I completed a professional certified training in Data Analytics with Boolean, which equipped me with some of those amazing data tools I have always wanted to master: SQL, Python, statistics, Tableu, machine learning and web scraping! Now looking forward to the next data challenge 💪

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics and Machine Learning
- 💼 I'm looking forward to starting a new job as Data Analyst, Business Analyst or Junior Data Scientist
- 👯 I’m excited to collaborate on Data Analytics and Machine Learning projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been training as aereal acrobat for a year an a half 🤸‍♀️
